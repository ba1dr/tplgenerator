    This file contains final aggregated settings for the project.
    Do NOT edit this file manually.
    All changes should be done in files base.py or local.py or /usr/local/etc/<%= @project_name %>.yaml

    Settings get overridden in this order:
    base.py -> (development/production).py -> local.py -> /usr/local/etc/<%= @project_name %>.yaml -> settings.py
    Most secret and server-specific settings should reside in .yaml file.
    Other files are stored in repository
